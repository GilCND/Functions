# Functions

## Create an application that prompts a user to enter two numbers. 
### Create 4 functions (addThem, subtractThem, multiplyThem, and divideThem) that accepts both entered values, does the appropriate mathematic operation, and sends the result back 
### to the program. After the numbers are entered (and verified), call each function in your program and display the result.
